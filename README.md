# Presenter Switch

The goal of this project is to allow automated triggering of content into HTTP clients listening on a [SSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events) connection.

## Running

Check out the repository and simply install the binaries (requires [Go](https://golang.org/) to be installed on your machine:

`git clone https://github.com/ubuconeurope/present-switch`
`cd present-switch/`
`go run ./server.go`

The server should then start listening on port `8000`.
